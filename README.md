# EasyMail
It is a Python program that helps ease the process of emailing. It uses Python libraries like pyttsx3 for voice commands, SpeechRecognition for letting the sender
creating the email using speech, and smtplib for sending the emails.

The user can create a favourite list of emails using which just saying the name(key) should get the email address, else he/she should say the receiver's entire email out loud to be recognised by speech recognition.
